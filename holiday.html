        <h2>Phi Hung and Truong Sinh were in a park in 2009</h2>
        <p>It's a strange feeling to visit a place you used to call home. The key still works, at least for now, and nobody is living here to replace all the spaces we left behind yet, but still, it's unsettling to witness this place not being my home anymore.</p>
        <p>There are corners and surfaces that I had never seen being empty before, for they'd always held on to various things since the day I set foot here. I had never seen the house being this clean before, either. Or this lonely. The walls have been repainted, curtains removed, and floors re-carpeted. My little room where I slept in for the past five years now feels like a stranger’s without my usual stuff. I came to California with just a suitcase and a backpack, but when I left, boxes of donation goods left as well. Those are things that I was given (mostly printed books), bought (secondhand clothes), or made (random DIY projects), but I no longer have enough love to keep them with me for the journey ahead. Will make a mental note to be more intentional with things I own in the future.</p>
        <p>I wonder who the next person to live in “my” room will be like. Will they decorate the door and windows the way I did? Will they put their bed and desk where I positioned mine? I thought about leaving them with something nice, but then I realized I didn't even know them, and the house would be cleaned out before they move in anyway. I wonder what they will do in that room where I used to study, work, sleep, exercise, sing, collapse, get up, call home, write about the past, plan for the future, and sometimes cry. I hope they will feel safe as much as I did when that space was once mine.</p>
