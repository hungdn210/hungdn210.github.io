        <h1>WE ARE A FAMILY, FOR THOSE JUGGLING RESPONSIBILITIES...</h1>
        <p>I attended a talk recently, mainly as a tech support person, and “accidentally” learned something so profound that I have to write it down before life moves too fast that I forget what I learned.</p>
        <p>The event was for mothers who are juggling work and raising young children. Basically, how can you have it all? The guest speaker is a three-time nonprofit founder, with one founded when she was two years out of college, and now in her early 30s, she is an executive leader where she works. On top of it all, she is a mom to her 3-year-old son and is expecting a second child. Although the topic of being a mother doesn’t apply to me, or maybe you, I think we can all relate from a family angle, or if not family, a group of other people/person whom we love. Whatever that group is, it is likely something that’s separate from your work, if you do work.</p>
